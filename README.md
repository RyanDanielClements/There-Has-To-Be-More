### There Has To Be More
##### *by Ryan Clements*

### Chapter 1-

As a kid my life was devoted to the game of hockey. I can vividly remember every year the excitement and nerves that would hit when hockey season would start back up. A locker room full of mostly strangers, who were always much bigger than me. Starting with try-outs, giving my all out on that ice. The other kids were just my competition, fighting for the same spot on the team that I was fighting for. I would nervously wait to see if I would make the first-cut, and afterwards the final team. Being invited to join the team was a moment of pride and accomplishment. I thought of how I’d be able to show off by wearing my team jacket to school. Then we would begin to practice. No longer were we fighting for a spot on the team, but rather setting our eyes on one goal- winning. As the season started something magical would always happen; we would truly become a team. We lived for the same purpose and chased after the same goals. These guys who only weeks ago were strangers to me were now as close as brothers. I could rely on them. We fought together, sat in the locker room in complete silence together after a loss, and blasted the music and celebrated together after each win. We were a team.

Then Sunday morning would roll around, out of season or when we didn’t have hockey that morning, and my mom would say, “we are going to church.” This meant we were going to a building where a bunch of Christians would get together, sing a few songs, listen to some guy speak, endure a few awkward conversations in the lobby, and then head to Costco (or whatever was planned for normal life that day).

 I didn’t understand it then, and I am still confused today. Is Church something that we can “go to” as if it were an event? Perhaps I’m missing something here, but my Bible says that the Church is the body of Christ. “All of you together are Christ's body, and each of you is a part of it.” The Church can’t just be an event, or even an organization. There simply has to be more.

Now to be fair, I would “go to hockey”. When we had games, at least a few friends and family members would show up and sit in the stands to cheer us on. But did attending the game mean they were on the team? Of course not. They were not there for the gruelling two hour off-ice training sessions every week. They didn’t skate laps until they felt like they would collapse at any moment. They didn’t truly feel the weight of a loss or the joy of a win like we did. They were just bystanders. When I went to hockey, I did it as a part of the team. When I “went to church” I did it as a bystander. 

Now the part that confuses me is- I don’t think I’m alone. It’s not that I’m an outsider; I believe all the same things as the other people in the room. I was invited to the team, signed my name on the contract, and waited for the season to begin; but it for the most part never has, at least not in the way a hockey season would. I don’t see the shared goal or the drive to accomplish our task at all costs. It feels like that first day of try-outs- sitting in the locker room but never actually getting on the ice.

So what is the goal for the Church? What shared purpose should we have that unites us as a team? How do we get out of the locker room and step foot on the ice? Well, at least conceptually the answer is simple- if Jesus is the head of the Church, then his goal must be our goal. Jesus has a mission, and as a part of this Body, we are to share in that mission. This mission, put very simply, is to save people. God “gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.” This is his mission, and if you are a part of the team, it is your mission as well. So what would this look like? We would at least expect to see, “church members meeting together throughout the week, meeting one another’s needs, and serving and reaching their community.”

So why get together on Sunday’s?

“It is no longer I who live”

True unity is found in a shared purpose.

“Members of one another”
